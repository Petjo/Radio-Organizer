This Software was written in C#/XAML and Visual Studio using naudio 1.6.0

IMPORTANT: This Software is a test project to develop myself in programming. So there can be many things to simplificate.

1. For testing Software use Visual Studio 2017 Community
2. You need to write your XML Page with one or two test links and adjust your local path and XML orders in classes for running or
   take orders/xml tags from my classes
3. Links must be .mp3 stream format
4. Some classes are still in developing, ignore them

##Buffering

If u have a slow internet connection, set buffersize in class streaming_http x2 or higher, for this it can take a longer time until stream begins

Ver 1.0
